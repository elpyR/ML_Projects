## SRL-BERT and SentenceTransformers for labelling text data and generating embeddings for TensorBoard Embedings Projector.

This script was developed using Jupyter Notebooks in Colab, and BERT models from allenNLP and HuggingFace:

SRL-BERT - https://demo.allennlp.org/semantic-role-labeling/semantic-role-labeling
SentenceTransformers - https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers

The embeddings were used in TensorBoard Embeddings Projector: https://projector.tensorflow.org/
